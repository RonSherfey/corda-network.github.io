Business Networks (Consortiums)
==============================

For Corda Network, Business Networks are groups of companies who wish to transact together using either Corda or our Enterprise version, for a specific commercial purpose. 

A Business Network **Operator** is a company who sets-up and operates the legal rules and business processes for the Business Network, often also designing and operating a shared CorDapp.

Depending on their size, Business Networks may also wish to
- onboard, offboard and bill their members - see the [business network membership service](https://github.com/corda-network/corda-network.github.io/blob/master/participation/bn-tools-intro.md)
- create their own governance structure, for decision-making and policies 

We continue to develop tools and features for Business Networks to work well. The team is currently developing an onboarding and member management website.
