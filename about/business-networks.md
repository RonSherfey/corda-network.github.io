Business Networks (Consortiums)
==============================

In Corda Network, Business Networks are groups of companies who wish to transact together - using either Corda Open Source or  Enterprise, for a specific commercial purpose. 

We see that Business Networks have many different governance models, including ranging from a consortium model, to a more centralized model with a **Business Network Operator**. A BNO may set-up and operate the legal rules and business processes for the Business Network, often also designing and operating a shared CorDapp. 

Depending on their size, Business Networks may also wish to onboard, offboard and bill their members - see the [business network membership service](https://github.com/corda-network/corda-network.github.io/blob/master/participation/bn-tools-intro.md)

We continue to develop tools and features for Business Networks to work well. Please visit the [Business Networks Toolkit](https://corda.network/about/businessnetworkstoolkit.html).

We also have a detailed solutions site on the options and flexibility which [Business Networks](https://solutions.corda.net/business-networks/intro.html) offer on Corda.
