Business Networks (Consortiums)
==============================

For Corda Network, Business Networks are groups of companies who wish to transact together using either Corda or our Enterprise version, for a specific commercial purpose. 

A Business Network **Operator** is a company who sets-up and operates the legal rules and business processes for the Business Network, often also designing and operating a shared CorDapp.

Depending on their size, Business Networks may wish to
- onboarding and offboard their members (see the business network membership service)
- bill their members (see the billing service)
- create their own governance structure, for decision-making

We hope to develop
