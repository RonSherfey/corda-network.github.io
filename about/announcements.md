They join James Carlyle and Carolyne Quinn who represent the Corda software developer R3. 

Current Chairman James Carlyle stated: “_I am extremely pleased to welcome the new directors to the board of the Corda Network Foundation. The number of business networks using Corda Network is growing, and new participants are joining those groups all the time, so the need for effective governance in order to uphold the Corda promise of interoperability across business applications is greater than ever. Governance of distributed ledger networks is new, and the board members will get a real chance to shape it for the entire industry.”_

New Directors bring a wealth of expertise and experience to the next phase of Corda Network’s growth to reach its full potential and deliver frictionless global interoperability for businesses. We are grateful for the significant contribution made by the Foundation's Transition Board. Achieving a 73% turnout of the elections demonstrates its success in establishing a vibrant Corda Network community.

**About Corda Network** 

Corda Network Foundation is a non-profit organisation that governs the Corda Network. Corda Network allows for the transfer of data and digital assets between communities of nodes (business networks) and different CorDapps. Participants can therefore create private ecosystems within their organisation, or with trusted commercial partners, while remaining interoperable with the wider Corda community where appropriate. Relevant information can be shared between applications and organisations  without the need for intermediaries, creating efficiencies and avoiding duplication. Corda Network also includes identity verification and privacy services to ensure that participants can operate on the network safely.

The legal entity is that found in the x500 cert. The node operator or Sponsor, if applicable, are not relevant.
All eligible legal entities get to vote for 3 Directors out of 9. If a legal entity has 2 nodes, it will have 2 opportunities to vote.
Any live legal entities may nominate up to 3 individuals for the Board, however in the end its likely only one will get through, according to the diversity criteria in the By-Laws (see Section 4).

Staggered Board Design

The 3 Directors with the most votes will get 3-year terms (July 2020 - July 2023)
The 3 Directors with the middle amount of votes will get 2-year terms (July 2020 - July 2022)
The 3 Directors with the lowest amount of votes will get 1-year terms (July 2020 - July 2021)
This is by design, to enable a staggered board. As such, from July 2021 onwards, on an annual basis, 3 directors' seats will become available on an ongoing basis
Notes

All of these rules are in the By-Laws of the Foundation. See Section 3.3 at https://corda.network/governance/bylaws
