RULES
A legal entity must have 1 node (Open Source / Enterprise) on the Production Network, by Tue 23 June 2020, to:

All eligible legal entities get to vote for 3 Directors out of 9. If your legal entity has 2 nodes, it will have 2 opportunities to vote.
The legal entity is that found in the x500 cert . The node operator or Sponsor, if applicable, are not relevant.
Individuals considering to stand for the Board should send a short application by 17th May 2020 - 6 weeks in advance of the vote. The vote is intended to take place on 30 June 20202 (further details to follow).
Staggered Board Design:
The 3 Directors with the most votes will get 3-year terms (July 2020 - July 2023)
The 3 Directors with the middle amount of votes will get 2-year terms (July 2020 - July 2022)
The 3 Directors with the lowest amount of votes will get 1-year terms (July 2020 - July 2021)
This is by design, to enable a staggered board. As such, from July 2021 onwards, on an annual basis, 3 directors' seats will become available on an ongoing basis
Existing Foundation Transition Board directors are eligible to stand again
 
Notes
1. All of these rules are in the By-Laws of the Foundation. See Section 3.3 at https://corda.network/governance/bylaws
2. There is a small chance this will be delayed slightly, if a long list of candidates are proposed.
