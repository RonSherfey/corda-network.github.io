- Staggered Board Design:
1.	The 3 Directors with the most votes will get 3-year terms (July 2020 - July 2023)
2.	The 3 Directors with the middle amount of votes will get 2-year terms (July 2020 - July 2022)
3.	The 3 Directors with the lowest amount of votes will get 1-year terms (July 2020 - July 2021)
4.	This is by design, to enable a staggered board. As such, from July 2021 onwards, on an annual basis, 3 directors' seats will become available on an ongoing basis
- Existing Foundation [Transition Board](https://corda.network/governance/board-election/) directors are eligible to stand again.
