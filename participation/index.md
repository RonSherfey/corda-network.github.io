Joining Corda Network
=====================

An outline of steps to join the Network (either the Pre-Production or Production network) is listed below. 

This assumes that participants wish to operate a node and already have access to at least one CorDapp which they wish to deploy, as well as other considerations listed.

| Step 1 | *Obtain Corda software* - either Open Source or Enterprise                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                   |
| Step 2 | *Trust Root*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Request from doorman@r3.com                                                                                       |
|        | Request the Trust Root from uatdoorman@r3.com                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                   |
| Step 3 | [Deploy the node](https://docs.corda.net/deploying-a-node.html) - where applicable, with help from a Corda representative.                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                   |
| Step 4 | [Configure the node](https://docs.corda.net/corda-configuration-file.html) – a node.conf file must be included in the root directory of every Corda node.                                                                                        |                                                                                                                   |
| 4.1    | **Choosing an email address.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                   |
|        | The email address should be non-personal (for example, admin@... or info@...), with suitable access, of the node operator organisation.                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                   |

|        | All nodes on Corda Network must have a Distinguished Name (DN) in their [participation certificate](https://docs.corda.net/corda-network/index.html#identity-service).                                                                           |                                                                                                                   |
|        | * Follow the guidelines [here](https://corda.network/participation/distinguishedname.html) to pick the right DN, as part of the onboarding process.                                                                                              |                                                                                                                   |
|        | * A DN will include a legal entity name for your node. For guidance on which legal entity name to pick for your node, see [here](https://corda.network/participation/legalentity.html).                                                          |                                                                                                                   |

|        | The Identity Manager does verification checks – upon receipt of a CSR, a number of identity-related checks will be conducted, before issuing a certificate.                                                                                      |                                                                                                                   |
