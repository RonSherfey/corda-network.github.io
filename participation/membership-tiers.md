Membership Tiers
================

Participation in Corda Network is for legal entities only. In general, the term 'participation' rather than 'membership' is used, as this is the terminology used for a Dutch Stichting in the laws governing it.

Currently there are two tiers for participation in Corda Network:
(1) Full participant
(2) Identity-only / sponsored participant

A **full participant** usually signs contracts directly with the Corda Network Foundation. They typically manage their own nodes and are part of one or several tightly-knit business network(s). They receive full onboarding support from the Network Operator, can be a member of multiple business networks and run multiple applications, have voting rights and can stand for the Foundation's board of directors.  

In contrast, **identity-only participants** typically are part of much larger, disparate business networks where participants only infrequently transact on Corda Network. They only need an identity for one application; are expected to receive on-boarding support from their business network or application provider, instead of the Network Operator; do not have voting rights and cannot stand for the Foundation's board of directors. They are issued with a certificate by the Network Doorman, they will be on the network map and a lower level of identity checking will have been done, given that they are part of a sponsored model.
