Filling in the right legal entity name for your node
========================================================

According to existing Corda Network guidelines, every node on Corda Network should represent a different legal entity to best enable interoperability for future operations. The legal entity name picked should be the owner of the assets which would be  transacted.

However, strictly speaking, for the nodes to function, itâ€™s only imperative that each name is unique. Despite this, if you may join other business networks in the future, it would be better overall to pick different legal entity names for each node. 

The legal entity name should match the name in the government official trade list, in which it is registered.

Here are some examples of government trade registers (list is a work in progress):
